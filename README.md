RAID-SCM
Risk Artificial Intelligence Detection - Supply Chain Model

This is the code behind the published research paper I wrote.

Overview
RAID-SCM is an innovative approach to supply chain management that integrates advanced AI techniques to enhance risk assessment and mitigation strategies. This project includes web scraping, NLP for sentiment analysis, topic generation with a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), and a neural network for predictive modeling.
